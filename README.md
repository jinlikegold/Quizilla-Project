# Quizilla-Project
 A fun throwback web1-style "quiz" - in progress!
 
I created this quiz initially as a "survey form" project for FreeCodeCamp in my first months of learning to code. Even at the time, I knew I wanted it to contain functionality too advanced for my skills at the time.
 
Now, after completing Scrimba's Meme Picker project, I am re-engaging with this older project and adding some JS.

Currently, I'm thinking through (and commenting my thought process in the main JS file) the Javascript functions required to make the quiz work and return a result to the user.
